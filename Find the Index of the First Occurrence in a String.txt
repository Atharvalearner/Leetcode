#Approach :
let p1 is length of str (haystack string) and p2 is length of target(needle string).
give for loop from 0 till length of p1-p2+1.
let give count intialize from 0.
while count is greater than p2 and character of haystack at i+count is equal to character of needle at count then increment the count .
and if count is equal to p2 means needle is found in haystack so return the index of needle.
else return -1.
