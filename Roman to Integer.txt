/*
# Approach :
1. we intialize 3 variables ans,number and prev as 0.
2. we iterate overall the string character hence we start iterating from last index of string while it will not become to 0 and we decrement it at a every iteration.
3. in switch cases we just assign the values to number of respected Romen letter.
4. we check after every iteration is that number is greater than prev or not if yes ,then we add ans with that number.else we substract that no. from ans.
5. and after that we assign prev as number for futher operation.
6. return the ans.
