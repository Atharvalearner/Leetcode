# Intuition :
1. If the number of vowels is 0, Bob wins because Alice has no vowels to pick.
2. If the number of vowels is odd, Alice can pick all of them on her turn. In this case, Bob will have no vowels left to pick on his turn, resulting in Bob losing.
3. If the number of vowels is even, say n, Alice can pick n - 1 vowels on her turn, leaving exactly 1 vowel (which is odd) for Bob. Bob will then be unable to pick any more vowels on his turn, resulting in Bob losing.
4. Therefore, if the count of vowels is greater than 0, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win.
