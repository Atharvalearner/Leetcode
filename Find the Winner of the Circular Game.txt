class Solution {
    public int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        int curr = 0;

# Approach :
1. Initialize the result variable res to 0.
2. Iterate through number of players from 2 to n. (as in recursion we're starting from bottom)
3. Update the result using the formula (res + k) % player_num.
4. Return the final result incremented by 1 to get the winner's position (1-indexed).

#  Complexity :
- Time : O(n)
- Space : O(1)
