/*
# Approach :
1. first we can check head or next of head is not equal to node.
2. then declare new listnode n and call recursion as reverseList and assign parameter as head.next
3. now , assign next of head.next as head.
4. and head.next is assign as null.
5. return the declared listnode n.
