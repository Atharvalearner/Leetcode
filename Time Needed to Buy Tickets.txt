# Intution :
we iterate array till kth element is not become 0, we iterate the array and check current element is greater than 0 if yes then we decrement it's value by one and increment count by one at every pass. and if our currnt element is kth and its value is become 0 that means we cannot need to iterate next we just return the pass count.
and if any element value is become 0 then we cannot need that element hence when that element is occurs we just skip it.

- Time : O(N^2)
- Space : O(1)
