# Intuition :
just traverse and count left and right nodes and return it.

# Approach :
1. traverse in left and count how many nodes exist in left.
2. same process do for right.
3. sum up left, right and 1, because we also must to include root node , hence return it as left + right + 1.

- Time complexity:O(N)
- Space complexity:O(N)
