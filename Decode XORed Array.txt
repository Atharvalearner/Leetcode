class Solution {
    public int[] decode(int[] encoded, int first) {
        int[] res = new int[encoded.length+1];
        res[0] = first;
        for(int i=0;i < encoded.length;i++){
            res[i+1] = res[i] ^ encoded[i];
        }
        return res;
    }
}

# Approach :
1. Initialize the res array for storing the result of length encoded.length + 1(according to constraint).
2. As we know our 1st element of res is first variable .hence, we direct declare res[0] as first.
3. Then we iterate over encoded array and find XOR Values.
4. because of we already declare our first element of result ,we find XOR value from i+1 index of encoded array.
5. result of i+1 is result of previos i index and current i index of encoded array.
6. return the result array.
