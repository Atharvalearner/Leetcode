# Code
```
class Solution {
    public String addBinary(String a, String b) {
        String ans = "";
        int i = a.length() - 1;
        int j = b.length() - 1;
        int carry = 0;
        while(i >= 0 || j >= 0 || carry == 1){
            int sum = carry;
            if(i >= 0){
                sum += a.charAt(i--) - '0';
            }
            if(j >= 0){
                sum += b.charAt(j--) - '0';
            }
            carry = sum / 2;
            ans = (sum % 2) + ans;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

# Approach: 

1. Initialize an empty string called ans to store the answer of strings.
2. Initialize a variable carry to store the carry.
3. Start from the last digit(RightMost) of both input strings and move towards the left.
4. In each iteration, add the current digits of both strings and the carry generated in the previous iteration.
5. Compute the sum modulo 2 and append the result to the result string.
6. Compute the carry as the integer division of the sum by 2.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 until there are no more digits in both input strings and the carry is zero.
8. Reverse the result string and return it.
